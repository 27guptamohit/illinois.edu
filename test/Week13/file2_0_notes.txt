Given that we're now approaching the end of the syllabus, it is time to now clean the code that we've worked on yet.

File 2.1: Cleaned and organized version of views.py
File 2.2: Cleaned and organized version of urls.py
File 2.3: Cleaned and organized version of base.html. The only new changes that are made is addition of new navigation buttons.

P.S.: You can use chatGPT to feed in your code for helping you to organize it.
In the current code, only structural changes were made but no changes were made to the past code.
