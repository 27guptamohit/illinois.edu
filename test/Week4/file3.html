<h2>Student List</h2>

    <!-- So the student_list_html has the list of all the students
     that are getting passed from students/views.py.
     Go to that file and try to locate 'student_list_html' -->

    <!-- Step 1: Create a for loop. This acts similar to the 'for' loop in python. -->
    {% for student_for_loop in student_list_html %}

        <li>
            <a href=""> {{ student_for_loop }}</a>

    <!-- Step 2: This function tells what to return in case table has no data. -->
    {% empty %}

        <li>No students yet!</li>

    <!-- Step 3: Tell html here that the for loop has ended.-->
    {% end for %}
