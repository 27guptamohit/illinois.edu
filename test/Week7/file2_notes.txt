1. In the imports for charts: students/views.py

    > from django.db.models import Count         <- Here

Count is not one of our models.
It’s a function (called an aggregate) that Django provides to perform SQL COUNT() operations inside queries.

    > data = Section.objects.annotate(student_count=Count("section_related_name"))

Here’s what happens in this code:

	•	Section.objects.annotate(...) means “take each section and add an extra field (student_count) that counts related students.”
	•	The "section_related_name" string matches the related_name I defined in my Student model (students/models.py):
	    > section = models.ForeignKey(
                       Section,
                       on_delete=models.PROTECT,
                       related_name="section_related_name"
                       )

    •	Behind the scenes, Django runs SQL like:

        > SELECT section.id, section.code, COUNT(student.id) AS student_count
          FROM section
          LEFT JOIN student ON student.section_id = section.id
          GROUP BY section.id;
